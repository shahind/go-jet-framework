# Go Jet
Go Jet is a fast and light-weight web framework for Go which is developed based on [Go-Jet](https://github.com/shahind/go-jet-framework).
Go Jet supports ORM models, routing, middlewares, mail, session, and authentication.
At the core it uses the fast web server [Aero Go](https://github.com/aerogo/aero) which provides the fastest performance so far.
